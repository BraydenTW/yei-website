                    Dr. Cameron's centers on the future of work, namely how
                    algorithmic management is changing the modern workplace and

                    earners. Professor Cameronâ€™s interactive talk will discuss
                    how algorithms, motivations, and incentives are shaping work
                    in the largest sector of the gig economy, the ride-hailing
                    industry. She even worked as a driver as part of her
                    research! Find out how about life in the drivers' seat and
                    how more than a million drivers work alongside algorithmic
                    managers.
