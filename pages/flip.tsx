          YEI EconClubs have the unique opportunity to apply to offer a
          Financial Literacy Introduction Program (FLIP) within their community.
          EconClubs accepted to FLIP will be paired with a partner nonprofit
          organization to deliver financial literacy workshops to underserved
          youths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, YEI will provide FLIP-affiliated EconClubs with
          year-round FLIP training sessions, our extensive 16-week FLIP
          curriculum including activities and post-session resources, and
          PVSA-certified volunteer hours for any members who volunteer with
          FLIP.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to ensure we are delivering high-quality workshops,
          participation in FLIP is limited to YEI EconClubs. If you do not have
          a YEI EconClub at your school, you may apply to start one{' '}
